            With a wrap-around patio on the main floor and community-style
            structure, Alumni Tower is a one-of-a-kind living opportunity here
            at MSU. This eight-story, air-conditioned, and fully-furnished hall

            serves as a break-housing opportunity for any resident who needs
            university housing during university closed periods. Different than
            other community-style halls, each residential floor has multiple
            private restrooms. These lockable single-occupant restrooms have one
            shower, one sink, and one toilet. This hall initially opened in 1967
            as an all-male residence hall and was named in honor of Morehead
            State University Alumni. Beginning in 2023, Alumni Tower also houses
            the Craft Academy on several floors.
